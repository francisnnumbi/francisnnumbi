Excited about programming, I've acquired foundational knowledge through books and tutorials, exploring various programming languages, including Java and Java Mobile, BlackBerry, Android, Swift, SwiftUI, Flutter/Dart, C++, C#, Visual Basic, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, jQuery, javax, Bootstrap, PHP, Laravel and MySQL.

I quickly learn and adapt to new technologies, tools, and programming languages.
